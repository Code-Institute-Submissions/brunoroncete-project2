# MATCH THE FLAGS

![Mockup](assets/images/mockup.png)

This comprehensive site was designed for the second of four Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. The main requirements were to make a responsive page that respond to the user's actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.
## UX

The purpose is to design an attractive website, so the players can enjoy and have fun with the game.

2. As a first time visitor, I want to have live scoring and a timer showing how long I take to win the game.

# Return Visitor Goals

1. As a return visitor, I want to enjoy the game.

## Design

## Testing

### Development Testing

-  I used the Google Chrome Developer tools during the development of the website to inspect the site at different device sizes and in responsive mode.

### Manual Testing

- Memory Game

1. When the company name is clicked, it returns the user to the index.html from all pages.
2. When each link on the navbar is clicked, it takes the user to the correct page.

- Social Media Links
1. When each link is clicked, it opens a new tab.
2. When each link is clicked, it takes the user to the correct page.

- Forms
1. When submitted the form link to the correct place.

I used the Lighthouse on Google Developer Tools to check the Perfomance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO of the website.

PowerMapper was used to double-check the browser compatibility.

### Issues
- The timer starts as soon as the user enter the page, but it should start after the first click. Restarting the game makes it retart the timer.

## Deployment

This project was developed using Visual Studio Code Insiders, committed to git and pushed to GitHub using git bash terminal.

### Deploying on GitHub pages

1. Log in to GitHub and navigate to the GitHub Repository.
2. At the top of the repository, select "Settings" from the menu items.
3. At the Settings menu, select "Pages".

The live link can be found here - https://brunoroncete.github.io/project2/

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps.

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
